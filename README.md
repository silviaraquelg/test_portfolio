# About Me
Hello! I am an experienced Lawyer and immigration and corporate professional with over 8 years of proven expertise in immigration law and corporate compliance. With skills in legal research and analysis, contract negotiation, regulatory compliance, and client advocacy, I am able to develop strategic legal solutions, and achieve successful outcomes for diverse clients. I am adept at using Visual Studio Code, Git/GitHub, and Linux/Unix-based systems.

My versatile skill set, commitment to equal justice, and passion for empowering individuals and businesses makes me a valuable asset to any team or organization. In my spare time, I enjoy volunteering with immigrant support organizations and staying informed about the business marketplace.
